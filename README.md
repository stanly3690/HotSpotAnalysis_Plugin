# Hotspot Analysis Plugin for QGIS

A QGIS Plugin to perform Hotspot analysis based on the Python Spatial Analysis Library - [PySAL]. 

The Hotspot analysis plugin associate the **Z-scores** and **p-values** (under Complete Spatial Randomness hypothesis) of the Gi* local statistic ([Getis and Ord, 1992]) for each feature of shapefile (points), with an assigned **projected coordinate system** and an associated **positive numerical attribute**. Output layer enables to indentify hotspots (or coldspots) in the input dataset as well as their statistical significance. 

Positive and statistically significant Z-score indicates intense cluster of high values (hotspot). Negative and statistically significant Z-score indicates intense cluster of low values (coldspot).

Spatial relation between features is modeled using a Fixed Distance Band (expressed with the same unit of measure of the projected coordinate system of the input shapefile), which allows to compute Gi* for any element by considering its neighborhoods within this fixed distance. For more information, please refer to: [Geospatial Analysis - 5th Edition, 2015 - de Smith, Goodchild, Longley]

Dependency Requirements:

  - **`PySAL`**
  - **`Numpy`**
  - **`Scipy`**

These libraries are not included in the QGIS core libraries and must be installed prior to the use of the plugin through the [OSGeo4W Shell] on **Windows**, or through terminal on **Ubuntu** and **macOS** (see the following).
___
### Installation - Windows OS

Download `get-pip.py` , to enable `PIP` functionalities, which is available at this link: <https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py> 

Open `OSGeo4W Shell` as `Administrator` and change the working directory where the `get-pip.py` file is stored and type :
```sh
 $ python get-pip.py
```
(Further information regarding `PIP` installation can be found in:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/installing/#install-pip-setuptools-and-wheel)

Download the following packages according to your Python version and your Operating System characteristics:
 
 `Numpy` : https://pypi.anaconda.org/carlkl/simple/numpy/ 

 `Scipy` : https://pypi.anaconda.org/carlkl/simple/scipy/ 
 
**Note**: for example, in the filename "numpy-1.10.0b1-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl " cp34, amd64 depicts python 3.4 and 64 bit Operating System

Change the directory to where the downloaded packages are stored and type the following commands:

```sh
 $ pip install numpypackagename
 $ pip install scipypackagename
```
**Note**: extension must be included with the filename
```sh
 $ pip install pysal
```

Download or clone the `GitHub` repository given below into QGIS Python Plugins folder:
https://github.com/stanly3690/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin/archive/master.zip

**Note**: default Plugins folder is:
```sh
 $ cd C:\Users\<your_user_name>\.qgis2\python\plugins
``` 
Open QGIS:

Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install plugins` -> `Settings` -> `Show also experimental plugins` 

In `All plugins` tab, look for `HotSpotAnalysis` and tick the checkbox.  
A new icon for Hotspot Analysis will appear on the QGIS main panel.
___
### Installation - Ubuntu

Open a **Terminal** and type the commands:
```sh
 $ sudo apt-get install python-numpy
 $ sudo apt-get install python-scipy 
```
To install **PySAL**:
```sh
 $ sudo pip install pysal
```
Change directory to QGIS Plugins directory, default is : 
```sh
 $ cd /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins 
``` 
Clone the `GitHub` repository into the earlier mentioned path:
```sh
 $  sudo git clone https://github.com/stanly3690/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin 
```
Then Open QGIS:

Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install plugins` -> `Settings` -> `Show also experimental plugins` 

In `All plugins` tab, look for `HotSpotAnalysis` and tick the Checkbox.  
A new icon for Hotspot Analysis will appear on the QGIS main panel.
___
### Installation - macOS

If you installed QGIS on your machine using this source : http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis , you would find the required dependencies (**Numpy - Scipy - Pysal**) in the list of the **Optional Python Modules**. You can install them directly from here: http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/python (strongly suggested)

Otherwise, open a **Terminal** and type the commands:
```sh
 $ sudo pip install numpy
 $ sudo pip install scipy 
 $ sudo easy_install pysal
```
Change directory to QGIS Plugins directory, default is: 
```sh
 $ cd ~/.qgis2/python/plugins
``` 
Open the folder:
```sh
 $ open . 
``` 
**Download and copy** here the unzipped repository folder (suggested):
https://github.com/stanly3690/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin/archive/master.zip

or Clone the `GitHub` repository into the earlier mentioned path:
```sh
 $  sudo git clone https://github.com/stanly3690/HotSpotAnalysis_Plugin 
```
Then Open QGIS:

Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install plugins` -> `Settings` -> `Show also experimental plugins` 

In `All plugins` tab, look for `HotSpotAnalysis` and tick the Checkbox.  
A new icon for Hotspot Analysis will appear on the QGIS main panel.

Presentation slides are available here: https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/danieleoxoli/hotspot-analysis-ogrs2016

**Note**: this material is based on the **old version of the plugin**! 

#####Annuncement 10/2016
The current version does not require Pyshp as well as to specify the feature coordinates as two separate fields in the attribute table of the input shapefile. Only the numerical attribute must be included and selected using the graphical interface on QGIS. Nevertheless, be sure that your input shapefile is projected. The unit of measure in which you express the analysis distance must agree with the one of the projected coordinate system of your input layer. 

#####Annuncement 11/2016
With this new version, the output layer is displayed with an **automatic style** which enables hotspot and coldspot visualization. Moreover, a **default Fixed Distance Band** is dispalyed. This latter represents the minimum distance to ensure 
at least 1 neighbor to any element of the dataset in order to compute spatial weights for Gi* 

#####Annuncement 12/2016
New check botton to eneable the usage of row standardized spatial weights
___
###Future work

Enable user to run hotspot analysis based on polygonal grid or multipolygon shapefile
